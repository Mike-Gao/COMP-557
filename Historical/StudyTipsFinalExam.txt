When studying for the final exam, if you are very short on
time and you must skip some of the post-midterm material, 
then I would recommend you skip items from the list below.  

For the pre-midterm material,  you should concentrate
on what you need for the post midterm material.  

[April 25:  Added  more  details on what you can cut from pre-midterm material.]

1-8 -  [nothing to cut]

9  -  Skip entire lecture (since material was covered on Assignment 2)
      
10 -  details of derivation of bicubic (although you should 
      understand the main idea of what is being done there)

11 -  simplification and subdivision

12 -  OpenGL lights and materials,  (slides 27-33)
   -  bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF)

16 -  [nothing to cut]

17 -  Details of Cal II calculation of normals for bump mapping.

18 -  [nothing to cut] 

19 -  Real time rendering of shadows: OpenGL pipeline (slides 18-21)
   -  How I used ambient occlusion in my research (slides 35-37)

20 -  OpenGL blending  (slides 25-35)
   -  chromakeying revisited: pulling a matte (slides 36-41)

21 -  OpenGL fog   (slides 16-24)
   -  Rendering level surfaces  (slides 35-39)

23 -  Physical vs. perceived color

24 -  Computing image blur. (slides 11, 12)
   -  Computing a high dynamic range image. (slides 33,34)

25 -  Display Calibration 2 i.e. without photometer 
   -  Limitations of 'global tone mapping operators'  


Other than that, I wish you good luck.  May the force be with you!
