Here is the Grading scheme used for A2.

1. Koch Pyramid (20 points)

   One level (10 points)
	60 degree angle: -5
	Wrong normal -5
   Recursive (10 points)
       If that doesn’t work, check if a pyramid of depth one works.
       Wrong rotation before recursion (smaller pyramids are going inside the larger pyramid) -5


2. L-system (30 points)

   exec_draw_cmd(20 points)
        Push/pop issues : - 4
        not align with X: -4
        translate: -4
        color spilled: -4
   Draw three plants (10 points)
         Not using all features (eg all lines.) -3

3. Hermite Curves (20 points)

    returned a matrix -5 => Tests will fail probably
    The return statement can be changed to "return (p.getA1(),m.getA1())"  
     If tests are ok, give full mark. Else, give part marks where it fails. 
   
   add_points(10 points)
   evaluate_curve_segment(10 points)


4. Bicubic Patch (30 points)
   
   If tests are ok and color normalization is ok, give full marks. 
   Else, give part marks where it fails. Still check for rendering.

   evaluate(10 points)
   set_color_from_XYZ(5 points)
        Not normalized between 0 and 1. -2
   draw_scene(15 points)	
        Not normalized. -0  [MODIFIED Mar. 29:  It used to say -5.  
        ITS OK IF SCENE GEOMETRY IS NOT NORMALIZED.  THIS WAS NOT A REQUIREMENT OF THE ASSIGNMENT.]

5. Garden Scene(20 points)

   Ground is a bicubic patch (5 points)
   LSystem(5 points)
   Ugly trees(-1 point)
   Tiles(10 points)
   LSystems (5 points)
  
   Any issues here with normals or positions I remove 5 points.
