Q2  
 -5 no comments explaining their method

    For those who implemented angle-axis rotation: 
 -2 if the degenerate cases (angle = 0/180)
    were not accounted for in the case of angle-axis rotation

    Note that some students observed that part of the head would disappear depending on viewing angle (e.g. part of the chin missing).
    This issue is attributed to the fact that a second rotation is needed to align the quads' up with cam up to prevent the quads from rotating.
    Otherwise the quads do not cover the entire texture for certain directions. 
    Because this was not made explicit on the discussion board, points will not be deducted.

    For those using GL matrix modes:
 -2 if they forgot to push/pop matrix if using GL modes
 -5 if they did not apply rotation to both GL_TEXTURE and GL_MODELVIEW

    For those who constructed a matrix:
 -5 transformation matrix not constructed properly/also applies for errors in inverse lookat matrix approach
 -2 if instead of using matrix modes, they did: 'quad_coord = np.dot(M, quad_coord)' but quad_coord is not constructed properly 
    or incorrect z coordinate when drawing (e.g. they may have had to replace z with quad_coord[2][i])
 
 -5  if quads exit bounding box/volume does not remain centered 
 -10 if it works for only one direction (e.g. only rotation about y-axis but no other), or if it stops working past certain angles. 
 -20/-25 if attempted but nothing appears on screen (blank screen), or if incomplete. (Basically students receive >= 5 pts if they started but did not complete enough)
 -30 if not attempted
